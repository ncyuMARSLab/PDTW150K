# PDTW150K Dataset
In this repository, we provide the dataset as described in the following paper:

Chan-Ming Hsu, Tse-Hung Lin, Yu-Hsien Chen, and Chih-Yi Chiu.PDTW150K: A Dataset for Patent Drawing Retrieval.

We introduce a new large-scale patent dataset termed PDTW150K for patent drawing retrieval. The dataset contains more than 150,000 patents associated with text metadata and over 850,000 patent drawings. In addition, a set of bounding box positions of individual drawing views is provided to support constructing semantic segmentation and object detection models. We demonstrate the possible ways of using PDTW150K, including image retrieval, cross-modal retrieval, and object detection tasks.
