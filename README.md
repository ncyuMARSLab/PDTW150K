# PDTW150K
We introduce a new large-scale patent dataset termed PDTW150K for patent drawing retrieval. The dataset contains more than 150,000 patents associated with text metadata and over 850,000 patent drawings. In addition, a set of bounding box positions of individual drawing views is provided to support constructing semantic segmentation and object detection models. We demonstrate the possible ways of using PDTW150K, including image retrieval, cross-modal retrieval, and object detection tasks.

More information and datasets will be available for download later.
